# Sake

Sake is a small personal reading stack built around a Svelte web app and a KOReader plugin.

The idea is simple: keep your library in one place, sync reading progress between devices, and make the KOReader workflow less annoying.

## What is in this repo?

- `sake` - the main web app and API (`Svelte 5` + `SvelteKit`)
- `koreaderPlugins` - the KOReader plugins used by Sake

## Notes

- Database migrations live in `z-ui` and are managed with Drizzle.
- KOReader plugin releases are served by `z-ui`, while plugin artifacts are stored in S3-compatible object storage.
- API route lookup is available in the app at `/api/_routes` and `/api/docs`.
- A self-host reference stack is available at `docker-compose.selfhost.yaml`.
